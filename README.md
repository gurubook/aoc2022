Just to learn some go and keep my mind at work, and check ChatGPT code generation abilities.
OpenAI has done a TREMENDOUS job, i'm really impressed.

I think that incomplete code is due to limitation to the allocated resources, code seem right until the stop.

day 1:
  - 1: chatGPT produced WORKING code
  - 2: chatGPT produced incomplete code

day 2:
  - 1 & 2 : chatGPT produced incomplete code

day 3: 
  - 1: chatGPT produced WORKING code
  - 2: chatGPT produced incomplete code

day 4: chatGPT produced code give the WRONG answer
